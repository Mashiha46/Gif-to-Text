### GIF
A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly Compressed Image. It is considered the most famous image format in the web world because of its portability and wide support with another image format; JPEG. GIF uses lossless data compression to reduce the size of the file without decreasing the quality but is only recommended to use for small graphics with limited colors due to its color constriction to 256 colors.
